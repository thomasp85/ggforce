\title{Create radial data in a cartesian coordinate system}
\usage{
radial_trans(r.range, a.range, offset = pi/2, pad = 0.5, direction = 1,
  clip = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{r.range}{The range in radius that correspond to 0 - 1 in the unit
circle.}

\item{a.range}{The range in angles that correspond to 2*pi - 0. As radians
are normally measured counterclockwise while radial displays are read
clockwise it's an inverse mapping}

\item{offset}{The offset in angles to apply. Determines that start position
on the circle. pi/2 (the default) corresponds to 12 o'clock.}

\item{pad}{Adds to the end points of the angle range in order to separate the
start and end point. Defaults to 0.5}

\item{clip}{Should input data be clipped to r.range and a.range or be allowed
to extend beyond. Defaults to FALSE (no clipping)}

\item{direction.}{Clockwise (1)/anticlockwise(-1) - default=1.}
}
\value{
A trans object. The transform method for the object takes an r
(radius) and a (angle) argument and returns a data.frame with x and y columns
with rows for each element in r/a. The inverse method takes an x and y
argument and returns a data.frame with r and a columns and rows for each
element in x/y.
}
\description{
This function creates a trans object that converts radial data to their
corresponding coordinates in cartesian space. The trans object is created for
a specific radius and angle range that will be mapped to the unit circle so
data doesn't have to be normalized to 0-1 and 0-2*pi in advance. While there
exists a clear mapping from radial to cartesian, the inverse is not true as
radial representation is periodic. It is impossible to know how many
revolutions around the unit circle a point has taken from reading its
coordinates. The inverse function will always assume that coordinates are in
their first revolution i.e. map them back within the range of a.range.
}
\note{
While trans objects are often used to modify scales in ggplot2, radial
transformation is different as it is a coordinate transformation and takes
two arguments. Consider it a trans version of coord_polar and use it to
transform your data prior to plotting.

\examples{
# Some data in radial form
rad <- data.frame(r = seq(1, 10, by = 0.1), a = seq(1, 10, by = 0.1))

# Create a transformation
radial <- radial_trans(c(0,1), c(0,5))

# Get data in x, y
cart <- radial$transform(rad$r, rad$a)

# Have a look
ggplot() + geom_path(aes(x=x, y=y), data = cart, color='forestgreen') +
  geom_path(aes(x=r, y=a), data = rad, color='firebrick')
