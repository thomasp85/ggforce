\title{Facet data for zoom with context}
\usage{
facet_zoom(x, y, xy, split = FALSE, horizontal = TRUE, zoom.size = 2,
  show.area = TRUE, shrink = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y, xy}{An expression evaluating to a logical vector that determines
the subset of data to zoom in on}

\item{split}{If both \code{x} and \code{y} is given, should each axis zoom
be shown separately as well? Defaults to \code{FALSE}}

\item{horizontal}{If both \code{x} and \code{y} is given and
\code{split = FALSE} How should the zoom panel be positioned relative to the
full data panel? Defaults to \code{TRUE}}

\item{zoom.size}{Sets the relative size of the zoom panel to the full data
panel. The default (\code{2}) makes the zoom panel twice the size of the full
data panel.}

\item{show.area}{Should the zoom area be drawn below the data points on the
full data panel? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{shrink}{If \code{TRUE}, will shrink scales to fit output of
statistics, not raw data. If \code{FALSE}, will be range of raw data
before statistical summary.}
}
\description{
This facetting provides the means to zoom in on a subset of the data, while
keeping the view of the full dataset as a separate panel. The zoomed-in area
will be indicated on the full dataset panel for reference. It is possible to
zoom in on both the x and y axis at the same time. If this is done it is
possible to both get each zoom separately and combined or just combined.

\examples{
# Zoom in on the versicolor species on the x-axis
ggplot(iris, aes(Petal.Length, Petal.Width, colour = Species)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_zoom(x = Species == "versicolor")

# Zoom in on versicolor on both axes
ggplot(iris, aes(Petal.Length, Petal.Width, colour = Species)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_zoom(xy = Species == "versicolor")

# Use different zoom criteria on each axis
ggplot(iris, aes(Petal.Length, Petal.Width, colour = Species)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_zoom(x = Species != 'setosa', y = Species == 'versicolor')

# Get each axis zoom separately as well
ggplot(iris, aes(Petal.Length, Petal.Width, colour = Species)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_zoom(xy = Species == "versicolor", split = TRUE)
