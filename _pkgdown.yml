  - title: "Shapes"
    desc: >
      Shapes are, in essence, anything with volume. These geoms allow you to
      draw differnt types of parameterised shapes, all taking advantage of the
      benefit of the `geom_shape` improvements to `geom_polygon`.
    contents:
      - geom_shape
      - geom_circle
      - geom_ellipse
      - geom_regon
      - geom_arc_bar
      - geom_bspline_closed
      - geom_diagonal_wide
      - geom_parallel_sets
      - geom_voronoi_tile
  - title: "Lines"
    desc: >
      The different line geoms are all parameterised versions of different line
      types, greatly easing your pain when needing a special type of stroke.
      Many of them have several versions depending on whether you want to show
      gradients along the lines, interpolate between endpoint aesthetics, or
      simply have a barebone version.
    contents:
      - geom_link
      - geom_arc
      - geom_bezier
      - geom_bspline
      - geom_diagonal
      - geom_spiro
      - geom_voronoi_segment
  - title: "Annotation"
    desc: >
      Annotation is important for storytelling, and ggforce provides a family of
      geoms that makes it easy to draw attention to, and describe, features of
      the plot. They all work in the same way, but differ in the way they
      enclose the area you want to draw attention to.
    contents:
      - geom_mark_rect
      - geom_mark_circle
      - geom_mark_ellipse
      - geom_mark_hull
  - title: "Facets"
    desc: >
      Facets are one of the greatest things in ggplot2, and ggforce comes with
      more of the awesomeness, both with variants of `facet_grid` and
      `facet_wrap`, as well as completely new takes on faceting.
    contents:
      - facet_matrix
      - facet_zoom
      - facet_row
      - facet_wrap_paginate
      - facet_grid_paginate
      - facet_stereo
  - title: "Scales"
    desc: >
      While separate packages comes with different palettes for already
      established scales, ggforce provides two completely new ones.
    contents:
      - scale_x_unit
      - scale_depth
  - title: "Transformations"
    desc: >
      Transformations can both be used to transform scales and coordinate
      systems but can also be used more broadly for describing specific types of
      spatial transformation of data.
    contents:
      - trans_reverser
      - power_trans
      - radial_trans
      - linear_trans
  - title: "Misc"
    desc: >
      ggforce contains an assortment of various stuff that doesn't fit into a
      bigger bucket. That doesn't make it any less useful.
    contents:
      - geom_sina
      - geom_autopoint
      - geom_autodensity
      - position_auto
      - position_jitternormal
      - gather_set_data
      - n_pages
      - theme_no_axes
      - ggforce-package
      - ggforce-extensions
